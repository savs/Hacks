Hacks
=====

This repository contains random hacks for various purposes. Too small to live on their own, but possibly useful, so collected here for posterity.

BlogMigration
-------------

I moved my blog from MovableType to WordPress. You can read more about <a href="http://www.andrewsavory.com/blog/2011/1602">the move</a>, or take a look at <a href="https://github.com/savs/Hacks/tree/master/BlogMigration">the hacks</a> that helped me achieve the move.

MobileLinuxStats
----------------

I'm interested in how the various mobile linux communities survive the political wranglings of the corporate sponsors. You can read the initial blog post <a href="http://www.andrewsavory.com/blog/2011/1553">At what price to community?</a>, see the <a href="http://www.andrewsavory.com/MobileLinuxStats/">main stats page</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/savs/Hacks/tree/master/MobileLinuxStats">review the scripts</a>.

OverTheAir
----------

Each year the <a href="http://overtheair.org/">Over The Air</a> conference and hackathon takes place, and a couple of times I have written hacks. I've <a href="http://www.andrewsavory.com/blog/2011/1550">written up my experiences</a>, and recently <a href="https://github.com/savs/Hacks/tree/master/OverTheAir">put the code on GitHub</a>. These are probably the worst examples of code ever, since they were written in just a few hours overnight whilst attending a conference.

In 2010, I did a mashup of <a href="https://hashblue.com/">#blue</a> with <a href="http://www.plaxo.com/">Plaxo</a>: if your contacts existed in Plaxo, it would show their real names instead of their mobile numbers in the list of SMS messages retrieved from #blue. This was a quick-and-dirty implementation in PHP, and also included a postgres database where extra data could be held (for example links to photos).

In 2011, I did a mashup of <a href="https://bluevia.com/en/">BlueVia</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/index.html">Google Maps</a>, and <a href="http://developer.pearson.com/apis">Pearson</a> data. The idea was to show interesting things near you. I took the <a href="https://github.com/BlueVia/BlueVia/tree/master/examples/node.js">BlueVia node.js example</a> as a starting point. The working example and use of <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node</a> allowed for quicker prototyping.
