Hacks
=====

This repository contains random hacks for various purposes. To small to live on their own, but possibly useful so collected here for posterity.

BlogMigration
-------------

I moved my blog from MovableType to WordPress. You can read more about <a href="http://www.andrewsavory.com/blog/2011/1602">the move</a>, or take a look at <a href="https://github.com/savs/Hacks/tree/master/BlogMigration">the hacks</a> that helped me achieve the move.

MobileLinuxStats
----------------

I'm interested in how the various mobile linux communities survive the political wranglings of the corporate sponsors. You can read the initial blog post <a href="http://www.andrewsavory.com/blog/2011/1553">At what price to community?</a>, see the <a href="http://www.andrewsavory.com/MobileLinuxStats/">main stats page</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/savs/Hacks/tree/master/MobileLinuxStats">review the scripts</a>.

OverTheAir
----------

Each year the <a href="http://overtheair.org/">Over The Air</a> conference and hackathon takes place, and a couple of years I have submitted hacks. I've <a href="http://www.andrewsavory.com/blog/2011/1550">written up my experiences</a>, and recently <a href="https://github.com/savs/Hacks/tree/master/OverTheAir">put the code on GitHub</a>. These are probably the worst examples of code ever, since they were written in just a few hours overnight whilst attending a conference.
